Marjolein van Leeuwen portfolio website
---------------------------------------
**First Milestone Project: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute**

This personal portfolio website is a display for prospective employers. 
It’s my way to make a good first impression.
Show them what my skills are and what I can create. 
Because my native language is Dutch, I made it an English/Dutch portfolio website. 

**User stories**

The first thing employers and recruiters see on my website is my name, my picture and a CV they can directly download.
The navigation bar allows users to quickly visit any section within my site.

**Strategy**

To create a clean design that draws attention and is easy for users.
With the parallax feature, the users take in an active role in their interaction with my site. 
This active role gives users the impression that they choose to engage with my site, making them more positive and more open to my message.

**Scope**

My goal for this website is to provide employers and recruiters a brief overview of myself and my skills. 
The users get a glimpse of who I am, read my story, see my coding skills and know how to contact me, if they want.

**Structure**

* In the home section, its possible to download my cv.  You can directly see my picture on the background and a download button for my CV.
* In the about section you read my personal story 
* In the work section you see my two projects I made during my fullstack development course for Code Institute
* In the Skills section, you see five coding languages I learned or will learn during my fullstack development course at Code Institute and how far my progress is.
* In the last section: Contact me through a contact form or Social Media

**Skeleton** 

* [Homepage wireframe][1a]
* [About wireframe][1b]
* [Work wireframe][1c]
* [Skills wireframe][1d]
* [Contact wireframe][1e]

**Surface**

I chose for the opacity css property for my background images, so it gives a more designed look. I chose the font 'Sans Open', because I like how this font looks like and its nice to read.

**Technologies**

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap
4. Javascript

**Features**

* This site uses the parallax feature to create an scrolling effect. 
* The navbar sticks on the top, and when you scroll down, it doesn't interfere with my content.
* 

**Testing**


**Deployment**
This site is hosted using GitHub pages

**Credits**

* Content
All content in the "About" and "Work" sections in this portfolio site were written by myself.
* Media: I used two photo's from unsplashed, a free stock image libary.
