Marjolein van Leeuwens Portfolio Website
---------------------------------------
**First Milestone Project: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute**

This personal portfolio website is a display for prospective employers. 
It’s my way to make a good first impression.
I would like visiters to get to know me personally and show them what my skills are and what I can create. 
Because I am from the Netherlands, I made it a bilingual portfolio website. 

**User stories**

The first thing employers and recruiters see on my website is my name, my picture and a CV they can directly download.
The navigation bar allows users to quickly visit any section within my site.
If the visiter would like to go back to the top, there is a back to top arrow on the right bottom side.

**Demo**

Add a nice screenshot of my website or video.

**Strategy**

* My strategy was to create a clean simple design that draws attention and is easy for users.
* With the parallax feature, the users take in an active role in their interaction with my site. 
This active role gives users the impression that they choose to engage with my site, making them more positive and more open to my message.

**Scope**

My goal for this website is to provide employers and recruiters a brief overview of myself and my skills. 
The users get a glimpse of who I am, read my story, see my coding skills and can contact me.

**Structure**

* The Home page features a responsive navigation bar. 
* The Navigation bar consists of an EN/NL, About, Work, Skills and Contact section.
* In the Home section, its possible to directly download my cv.  You can see my picture on the background and a download button for my CV.
* In the About section you read my personal story .
* In the Work section you see my two projects I made during my fullstack development course for Code Institute
* In the Skills section, you see the progress of my coding languages.
* In the Contact section: The visiter can contact me through a contact form.


**Skeleton** 

The wireframe was made in Balsamiq. It was a good first draft and idea of what I wanted my Portfolio Website to look like.
Along the way of making my website I discovered some things I made in my wireframe were not functional or difficult to create.
So my website has not become exactly like the wireframe I created.

* [About wireframe][1b]
* [Work wireframe][1c]
* [Skills wireframe][1d]
* [Contact wireframe][1e]

**Surface**

* I chose for the opacity css property for my background images, so it gives a more designed look. 
* My website is in color

**Technologies**

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap

**Features**

* This site uses the parallax feature to create a scrolling effect. 
* The navbar sticks on the top, and when you scroll down, it doesn't interfere with my content.
* The visiter is able to switch languages EN/NL in the navigation bar.
* I used a scroll top button (arrow) in the website, so you can return quickly to my navigation bar.
* In the Footer (on the right) the visiter can click on my social platform links: Github, Instagram and LinkedIn.
* The Footer contains copyright info.

**Features Left to Implement**

* In the future I would like to add moving texts and animations with CSS. I tried doing this, but I failed, because I had difficulty implementing and understanding this code. 
* In the work section I would like to make flipcards, so it is less static and more playful.

**Testing**

- The Navigation bar takes you to the different sections in my website. 
- The arrow top button takes you back to the homepage. 
- When the visiter switches languages, they see a dutch written portfolio website. 
- At the work section the visiter is able to click on my 2 projects I made for Code Institute. 
The links bring you to my demo cupcake recipe and Marjoleins Portfolio Website.
- In the contact section visiters are able to fill out the contact form and click on send. 
A modal (in CSS code) will let the visiter know that this contact form does not send a message and will not gather personal data.
- In the footer the links take you to my social platforms.
- **All links have been manually tested**

This site was tested on the Chrome browser and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 5, 6, 7, 8, iPad, Ipad-pro, Iphone X, Moto G4, Galaxy S5, Pixel 2 and Pixel2XL) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. 
During the testing phase I had difficulty with the padding in the light section.......

**Deployment**

This project was developed using the Github pages.

I followed the next steps to deploy my page on the Github pages:

* Log into GitHub.
* Select Sweetzia/Personal-Portfolio-Website in the repository list.
* From the menu items near the top of the page, select Settings.
* Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.
* Under Source click the drop-down menu labelled None and select Master Branch
* On selecting Master Branch the page is automatically refreshed, the website is now deployed.
* Scroll back down to the GitHub Pages section to retrieve the link to the deployed website.
