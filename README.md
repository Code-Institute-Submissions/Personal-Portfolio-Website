Marjolein van Leeuwen portfolio website

First Milestone Project: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This personal portfolio website is a display for prospective employers. It’s my way to make a good first impression and help me, put my work “out there”. Because my native language is Dutch, I made it an English/Dutch portfolio website. 

Demo

Strategy
Create a clean design that draws attention and is easy for users.

Scope
My goal for this website is to provide employers and recruiters a brief overview of myself and my skills. The users get a glimpse of who I am, read my story, see my coding skills and how to contact me, if they want.

Structure
* In the home section, its possible to download my cv.  You can see through a …… that I am Marjolein,a nurse and learning to code.
* In the about section you read my personal story 
* In the work section you see my two projects I made during my fullstack development course for Code Institute
* In the Skills section, you see five coding languages I learned or will learn during my fullstack development course at Code Institute and how far my progress is.
* In the last section: Contact me through a form or Social Media


Skeleton 

* Homepage wireframe
* About wireframe
* Work wireframe
* Skills wireframe

Surface: The melissa effect (pixlr.com) was chosen to make a warm and retro feel for the users. And I chose the font Acme, because I like that is is inspired by the visual language of classic cartoons and comics.

Technologies

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.4)

Features

This site uses the scrollSpy feature in Bootstrap with an extra JavaScript function added to create a 'smooth scrolling' effect. The navbar also stays collapsed regardless of the screen size to promote a minimalist design. (Haley Schafer)

All content in the "About/over my and "Work/Werk” sections in this portfolio site were written by me.

Media

All photos wee taken from unsplashed or pexel, a stock image libary, with the exception of the photo of myself in the background of the 'about/over my’ section in the desktop view. A pinkscale filter was applied to each one prior to upload to preserve the pinkscale theme.
